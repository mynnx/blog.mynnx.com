Names are hard.

Phil may have been joking, but there's a lot of truth in this statement.  It's hard enough to name a variable that's only going to be in scope for 5 lines, let alone 
naming *another human being*:

+ With any luck, the name you choose will last 100 years or more.
+ You're going to be speaking that name *every day* for the next 18 of those 100 years.
+ Perhaps most importantly, your kid's name [may affect his or her chances of success](http://healthland.time.com/2011/12/02/how-baby-names-affect-your-childs-future/).

Help exists!
------------
So, it's no wonder that parents turn to technology for help with choosing a name.  There are a million websites out there, each with its own set of features - "[find a name with a special, personal meaning!](http://www.babynames.com/)", "[make sure the name you choose still has an available domain!](https://awesomebabyname.com/)", and the list goes on.  

Would anyone call them "fun" to use?
------------------------------------
I doubt it - which, if you ask me, is a problem!  If you're about to bring a bundle of joy into the world, why should naming it be a dry, boring experience?

I would like to introduce you to something I call "[What the Fuck Should I Name My Child?](http://whatthefuckshouldinamemychild.com/)", the first baby-name tool designed for your adult eyeballs.

Inspired by [The Fucking Weather](http://thefuckingweather.com/) and [What the Fuck Should I Make For Dinner](http://whatthefuckshouldimakefordinner), it's...offensive.  It's brash.  It's rude.  I know.

However...
----------
WTFSINMC uses a surprisingly good algorithm to give you names for boys- and girls-yet-to-be.  Also, if you're not into the whole "[gender-assignment-at-birth](http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2014/06/26/infant_gender_assignment_unnecessary_and_potentially_harmful.html)" thing, WTFSINMC has you covered too!

Even if you're not planning to make spawn any time soon, I encourage you to check out WTFSINMC.  I hope you get a chuckle (or two) out of it.

The "real" reason I built this thing
------------------------------------
All that said, this site was primarily an excuse to practice web development, learn Backbone, and play with shiny workflow tools such as Grunt.  I'm going to be writing a few blog posts in the near future about the technology I used, about the lessons I learned, and about my ideas for the site if it takes off.

Check out the [source on Github](https://github.com/mynnx/what-the-fuck-should-i-name-my-child/), [share](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FWTFSINMC%2F&display=popup&ref=plugin) it with your friends, and most importantly - please let me know if WTFSINMC helped you find a name!

I'll leave you with some comments from Reddit:
> Love this!! It spit out 3 names that were already on our short list!!!  --[RoxMyPinkJox](http://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/25yfx9/need_any_help_naming_that_little_human_inside_you/chmdh06)

> So anyway, thanks for the link! We seriously found a name we'd not thought of and I said it out loud, and he said THAT'S IT! --[Milfanie](http://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/25yfx9/need_any_help_naming_that_little_human_inside_you/chmg5l9)

> Hilarious, I put in our last name and it actually suggested the name we chose on the first go. --[Lucky86](http://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/25yfx9/need_any_help_naming_that_little_human_inside_you/chlznya)
